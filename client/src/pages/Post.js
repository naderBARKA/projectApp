          Having worked in the field of Eating Disorders since 2005, we have
          seen many articles and presentations on ‘Food Addiction’, a topic
          which has gained greater interest in recent years as public health
          concerns over obesity have increased. Despite wide interest and
          research in the area, the concept of Food Addiction remains
          controversial with strong feelings on both side of the issue. we spend
          many years studying the genetic and neurobiological basis of both drug
          abuse and binge-eating behaviors and while there are certainly some
          similarities in the two areas, there are notable differences. There
          are three important concepts to know related to the idea of addiction:
          dependence, tolerance, and compulsive- or loss of control- use.
          Dependence refers to the idea that people who abuse drugs or alcohol
          have a withdrawal syndrome when they suddenly stop using. Alcohol has
          well-known and dangerous withdrawal syndrome (racing heart, elevated
          blood pressure, tremor, hallucinations, seizures, and potentially
          death), but withdrawal occurs for most drugs of abuse including
          cocaine, opiates, and nicotine. Food however is not associated with
          withdrawal symptoms in marked distinction from drugs of abuse.
          Tolerance, the second concept relevant to addiction, is the idea that
          drug abusers either have diminished pleasure from a drug after
          prolonged use or must take increasing amounts of the drug to get the
          same effect. Opiates, such as heroin or oxycodone, are notorious for
          producing tolerance resulting in dramatic escalation in use over time.
          Again though food addiction does not fit neatly with the concept of
          tolerance.

          In the absence of physical dependence or tolerance, we most often see
          people using the idea of ‘compulsive overeating’ to argue that food is
          addictive. Common examples that we see presented to justify this claim
          include people with extreme BMIs who can’t lose weight by diet alone
          despite the health consequences and people with binge-eating who
          consume unusually large amounts of food despite their desire not to. A
          closer look at genetic studies of patients with extreme obesity or
          eating disorders, however casts doubt on the concept of food
          addiction. Both conditions are highly heritable meaning that
          variations in the DNA that we receive from our parents at conception
          increases the risk of developing either disorder later in life.
          Research from Sadaf Farooqi at the University of Cambridge and others
          in the field have found that mutations in genes such as the
          melanocortin 4 receptor are associated with extreme obesity. The
          melanocortin 4 receptor is one of the molecules in your body
          responsible for telling the brain how much energy is stored in the
          body. The brains of people with mutations in the melanocortin 4
          receptor belief that they are starving despite having abundant adipose
          tissue. Similarly work our laboratory and others has found that
          patients with binge-eating behaviors are more likely to have mutations
          in genes for satiety hormones like glucagon-like peptide 1. People
          with mutations in glucagon-like peptide 1 continue to feel hungry even
          after a large meal. These two examples illustrate an important
          difference between food and drugs of abuse. The body needs food to
          survive and has evolved to sense the amount of energy it has stored.
          When energy levels drop to dangerously low levels, the brain responds
          by increasing the motivation to eat high calories foods at any cost in
          order to survive. If a person was lost in the woods for weeks with
          nothing to eat, no one would accuse them of being 'addicted to food'
          after breaking into a cabin that they happen to stumble upon to look
          for food. In the same sense, we don’t believe that it is fair to call
          food ‘addictive’ when people have impairments in their ability to
          regulate appetite and energy balance. Food is pleasurable, and that
          can lead to poor choices at times, but the fundamental processes of
          drug addiction and compulsive overeating are different and that
          distinction is important for treating patients who suffer from both.
